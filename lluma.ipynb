The main goal of CBT is to identify and challenge negative thought patterns, also known as cognitive distortions, that lead to damaging emotional reactions or behaviors. For someone dealing with anxiety, identifying and disputing the unrealistic fears, Worrisome Thoughts and False Beliefs can be essential in reducing their overall anxiety level. A core technique used in CBT for managing anxiety is called cognitive restructuring, which involves actively replacing negative thoughts with more balanced, realistic ones.\n\nMindfulness, on the other hand, is a practice that helps individuals become more aware and focused on the present moment without judgment. Mindfulness can help reduce stress, improve focus, and enhance emotional resilience. In the context of anxiety treatment, mindfulness practices such as meditation and deep breathing can help calm the nervous system and allow someone to observe their anxious thoughts without becoming overwhelmed by them.

It's a goal-oriented therapy that emphasizes the present moment, as well as the relationship between thoughts, feelings, and actions.\n\nMindfulness practices, on the other hand, originate from Buddhist traditions and have gained widespread use in secular settings due to their potential to enhance self-awareness, focus attention, and reduce stress. Mindfulness involves paying nonjudgmental attention to the present moment, often through meditation or other mindful activities.\n\nIn terms of techniques, a core component of CBT is cognitive restructuring, which helps individuals identify and challenge irrational or unhelpful thought patterns.

GAD is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry about a variety of things for most days of the week for at least six months. Additionally, people with GAD often have physical symptoms such as heart palpitations, restlessness, and difficulty concentrating. However, it's important to note that only a mental health professional can make an official diagnosis. If you are concerned about your symptoms, I would recommend reaching out to a healthcare provider for an evaluation. They can help determine if GAD or another condition is causing your symptoms and provide appropriate treatment options. In the meantime, there are things you can do to manage anxiety, such as practicing relaxation techniques, getting regular exercise, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol.\\n\n-----------------------------------------\n-> Final Answer with RAG:\\nYou may be experiencing some symptoms similar to those found in people diagnosed with anxiety disorders, but I am unable to definitively diagnose or determine whether your experiences are a part of a larger condition based solely on the information provided. Anxiety is a common human emotion and can manifest differently for each person. If you're feeling consistently worried, have racing heartbeats, or have trouble concentrating that affects your daily life, I highly recommend discussing your symptoms with a trusted healthcare professional or therapist to determine any next steps in exploring the possible causes and available treatments tailored to your specific situation. They will be able to assess your symptoms within the proper context of your medical history and current situation while also providing additional resources to support your emotional wellbeing.

Both medication and therapy, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), can be effective treatments for depression. The choice between the two often depends on individual circumstances, such as the severity and duration of symptoms, personal preferences, and other factors.\n\nIt's essential to discuss your options with your healthcare provider, who can help you make an informed decision based on your specific situation. Here are some things to consider:\n\n1. Severity of Symptoms: If your depression symptoms are severe, you might want to consider medication in conjunction with therapy to alleviate the intensity of symptoms more quickly and effectively. Medication may also be helpful for individuals experiencing persistent low moods or a lack of energy.\n\n2. Previous Experience with Medications: Consider whether you have had positive experiences with antidepressant medications in the past. If so, medication might be an effective option to manage your symptoms.\n\n3. Personal Preferences: Some people prefer the idea of therapy because it offers a more active role in their recovery process and can help them develop coping skills for managing symptoms. Others might prefer medication for quicker symptom relief\\n\n-----------------------------------------\n-> Final Answer with RAG:\\nDear User, I'm Lluma, a helpful mental health assistant designed to provide information based on available knowledge. Based on your concern about your diagnosed depression and whether to pursue medication or therapy like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), I cannot provide specific recommendations, as I am an AI and not a doctor. However, I can share some general insights that might help you in making this decision with the guidance of your healthcare professional.\n\nMedication, specifically antidepressants, can be an effective treatment option for many people living with depression by balancing out neurotransmitter levels in the brain. They may help alleviate symptoms such as low mood, lack of energy, and difficulty concentrating. However, they come with potential side effects and risks, which should be discussed thoroughly with your doctor.\n\nOn the other hand, therapy like CBT can be an excellent choice for individuals seeking to understand their thought patterns, emotions, and behaviors better. It is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on changing negative thought patterns and beliefs, helping you develop coping skills, and improving overall emotional resilience. The benefits of CBT are long-lasting, as the skills you learn during therapy can help you\\n\n-----------------------------------------\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Test Case 3\nanxiety_query = \"It all feels so hopeless and I don't know if I can go on.
